QvA tuner
---------

This android app analyzes the audio stream incoming through your device's microphone to display the current frequency as music note.
Easy way to tune your instrument or retrieving the music note fitting with the sound you hear


The app is in 'Closed Test' phase at Google Play
### [Test the app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.qva.qvatuner)

NOTE : 
- that webpage and it's content is controlled by Google Play
- which is gathering 'Closed Test' statistics for this tuner app
- which I can view as 'Google Play Developer' of the android 'Qva Tuner' app
- Once tested enough, it can be produced, ie. released in Google Play public
