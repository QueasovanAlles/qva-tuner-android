# QvA tuner

This android app analyzes the audio stream incoming through your device's microphone to display the current frequency as music note. Easy way to tune your instrument or retrieving the music note fitting with the sound you hear

## Testing Status
The app is in 'Closed Test' phase at Google Play : only members of the google group qva-tuner have access.
However : The google group is open for everybody without any needed extra communication. 

### [Register to the test (no costs, free usage)!](https://groups.google.com/g/qva-tuner)

### [Download the app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.qva.qvatuner)

## For developers
This is a sample of an android app using nothing but local assets and so being offline available. 
Those local assets contain the built angular webapp Qva-Tuner.
Interaction between the webapp, shown in a WebView, and the android app and manifest settings,
providing microphone availability, may be the educative part of this repo.

## For users
This is what you can expect
